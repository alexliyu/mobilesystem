# We can't pick up the list of applications when this module is imported, as

# Instead, (the outer) SearchForm creates the desired class when an instance
# is first required and transparently returns the result of calling its
# constructor.

# [0] e.g. Another app is being loaded which depends on mobile.apps.search.
#     mobile.apps.search.forms then tries to call all_apps, which would attempt
#     to load the other app again (and fail).
